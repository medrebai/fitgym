# 🏋️‍♂️ FitGym – Gym Management Web App

FitGym is a **demo gym management application** built with **Angular 16**, designed to demonstrate a full-featured front-end system integrated with a mock REST API powered by **JSON Server**, and **Firebase Authentication** for secure login and registration.

It allows managing gym members, coaches, classes, football court reservations, and subscriptions — all from an intuitive dashboard.

|--------|--------------|
| 🧍‍♂️ **Members** | Add, edit, delete, and view members with full profile data (weight, height, goals, preferred workout time, etc.). |
| 🧑‍🏫 **Coaches** | Manage coach profiles, specialties, and experience. Members can also book **coach sessions**. |
| 🧘‍♀️ **Classes** | Create and list gym classes with category, time, price, and assigned coach. |
| 💳 **Subscriptions** | Track active subscriptions, duration, payment method, and price, with a visual summary dashboard. |
| ⚽ **Football Courts** | Reserve football courts by time and date. View member-specific reservations. |
| 🔒 **Authentication** | Login and Register using **Firebase Authentication** (email/password-based). |
| 📊 **Dashboard** | Interactive overview of members, subscriptions, and reservations. |

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

FitGym follows a **modular Angular architecture** separating concerns into feature-based modules and services:

```

src/
├── app/
│   ├── components/            # Reusable UI components
│   ├── models/                # TypeScript interfaces for data models
│   ├── services/              # REST API services (MemberService, CoachService, etc.)
│   ├── pages/                 # Core pages (Dashboard, Login, Register, etc.)
│   ├── dialogs/               # Angular Material Dialogs for CRUD and view details
│   ├── app-routing.module.ts  # Route configuration
│   ├── app.module.ts          # Root module
│   └── app.component.*        # Entry component
├── assets/                    # Static assets (images, icons)
└── environments/              # Environment configs (Firebase, API base URLs)
